# Fundamentals Of Java Programming

This repository serves as a notebook for simple Java programs I completed as part of an online course on Java programming from Board Infinity through Coursera. The course provided hands-on exercises to build a strong foundation in Java programming concepts.

## Overview
This repository includes various Java programs that cover fundamental concepts, such as:
- Variables and Data Types
- Conditional Statements (if-else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Functions and Methods
- Arrays and Collections
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- Exception Handling

## Structure
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different topic or concept from the course. Inside each folder, you will find Java source files (`.java`) with simple programs that demonstrate the concept.

## Usage
To run any of the programs:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/d1solis/Fundamentals_Of_Java_Programming.git
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Navigate to the desired program and run it using the IDE's run configuration.

## Course Information
These programs are part of the exercises from the Fundamentals of Java Programming course by Board Infinity. The course covered the basics of Java and helped me build a solid understanding of the language.
